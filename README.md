# Mage SDK API Documentation
Distributing products globally should not be a one price fits all strategy. Get started with Mage to scale your products worldwide!

This is a documentation of the Mage API used by the SDK's. In case you're interested to write your own bridges feel free to do so or even better: publish your own open-source SDK.
The API is documented according the [openapi3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md) standard.
